# Dinder

A new tinder-like swiping app used for fellow students to share a meal together

## Detailed Information

Meeting new people and finding social connections are common challenges faced by college students. Additionally, many students also encounter various difficulties in their personal and academic lives and may lack the necessary resources and support. In response to these challenges, Dinder offers a unique platform for students to connect with each other over a shared meal and provide mutual assistance. Students can sign up for Dinder as either a donor or a receiver, with donors listing their extra meal swipes and interested receivers connecting with them to arrange a meal while offering various forms of support in exchange, such as help with homework, personal problems, and career advice. A simple matching algorithm based on user preferences is used, instead of complex matching algorithms that would not scale. A reciprocal score that measures the compatibility between a user and each potential candidate based on profile information, filters, and queries, will be used to provide more accurate matches and increase the likelihood of a successful connection.
